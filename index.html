Learn how to scrape the web with Python!

The internet is an absolutely massive source of data — data that we can access using web scraping and Python!

In fact, web scraping is often the only way we can access data. There is a lot of information out there that isn't available in convenient CSV exports or easy-to-connect APIs. And websites themselves are often valuable sources of data — consider, for example, the kinds of analysis you could do if you could download every post on a web forum.

To access those sorts of on-page datasets, we'll have to use web scraping. 

Don’t worry if you’re still a total beginner!

In this tutorial we’re going to cover how to do web scraping with Python from scratch, starting with some answers to frequently-asked questions.

Then, we’ll work through an actual web scraping project, focusing on weather data.

web scraping weather data with python
We'll work together to scrape weather data from the web to support a weather app.

But before we start writing any Python, we've got to cover the basics! If you’re already familiar with the concept of web scraping, feel free to scroll past these questions and jump right into the tutorial!

The Fundamentals of Web Scraping:

What is Web Scraping in Python?
Some websites offer data sets that are downloadable in CSV format, or accessible via an Application Programming Interface (API). But many websites with useful data don’t offer these convenient options.

Consider, for example, the National Weather Service’s website. It contains up-to-date weather forecasts for every location in the US, but that weather data isn’t accessible as a CSV or via API. It has to be viewed on the NWS site:

nws

If we wanted to analyze this data, or download it for use in some other app, we wouldn’t want to painstakingly copy-paste everything. Web scraping is a technique that lets us use programming to do the heavy lifting. We’ll write some code that looks at the NWS site, grabs just the data we want to work with, and outputs it in the format we need.

In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to perform web scraping using Python 3 and the Beautiful Soup library. We’ll be scraping weather forecasts from the National Weather Service, and then analyzing them using the Pandas library.

But to be clear, lots of programming languages can be used to scrape the web! We also teach web scraping in R, for example. For this tutorial, though, we'll be sticking with Python.



How Does Web Scraping Work?
When we scrape the web, we write code that sends a request to the server that’s hosting the page we specified. The server will return the source code — HTML, mostly — for the page (or pages) we requested.

So far, we're essentially doing the same thing a web browser does — sending a server request with a specific URL and asking the server to return the code for that page.

But unlike a web browser, our web scraping code won't interpret the page's source code and display the page visually. Instead, we'll write some custom code that filters through the page's source code looking for specific elements we’ve specified, and extracting whatever content we’ve instructed it to extract.

For example, if we wanted to get all of the data from inside a table that was displayed on a web page, our code would be written to go through these steps in sequence:

1
Request the content (source code) of a specific URL from the server
2
Download the content that is returned
3
Identify the elements of the page that are part of the table we want
4
Extract and (if necessary) reformat those elements into a dataset we can analyze or use in whatever way we require.
If that all sounds very complicated, don't worry! Python and Beautiful Soup have built-in features designed to make this relatively straightforward.

One thing that’s important to note: from a server’s perspective, requesting a page via web scraping is the same as loading it in a web browser. When we use code to submit these requests, we might be “loading” pages much faster than a regular user, and thus quickly eating up the website owner’s server resources.


Why Use Python for Web Scraping?
As previously mentioned, it’s possible to do web scraping with many programming languages.

However, one of the most popular approaches is to use Python and the Beautiful Soup library, as we'll do in this tutorial.

Learning to do this with Python will mean that there are lots of tutorials, how-to videos, and bits of example code out there to help you deepen your knowledge once you’ve mastered the Beautiful Soup basics.


Is Web Scraping Legal?
Unfortunately, there’s not a cut-and-dry answer here. Some websites explicitly allow web scraping. Others explicitly forbid it. Many websites don’t offer any clear guidance one way or the other.

Before scraping any website, we should look for a terms and conditions page to see if there are explicit rules about scraping. If there are, we should follow them. If there are not, then it becomes more of a judgement call.

Remember, though, that web scraping consumes server resources for the host website. If we’re just scraping one page once, that isn’t going to cause a problem. But if our code is scraping 1,000 pages once every ten minutes, that could quickly get expensive for the website owner.

Thus, in addition to following any and all explicit rules about web scraping posted on the site, it’s also a good idea to follow these best practices:

Web Scraping Best Practices:
Never scrape more frequently than you need to.
Consider caching the content you scrape so that it’s only downloaded once.
Build pauses into your code using functions like time.sleep() to keep from overwhelming servers with too many requests too quickly.
In our case for this tutorial, the NWS’s data is public domain and its terms do not forbid web scraping, so we’re in the clear to proceed.

The Components of a Web Page
Before we start writing code, we need to understand a little bit about the structure of a web page. We'll use the site's structure to write code that gets us the data we want to scrape, so understanding that structure is an important first step for any web scraping project.

When we visit a web page, our web browser makes a request to a web server. This request is called a GET request, since we’re getting files from the server. The server then sends back files that tell our browser how to render the page for us. These files will typically include:

HTML — the main content of the page.
CSS — used to add styling to make the page look nicer.
JS — Javascript files add interactivity to web pages.
Images — image formats, such as JPG and PNG, allow web pages to show pictures.
After our browser receives all the files, it renders the page and displays it to us.

There’s a lot that happens behind the scenes to render a page nicely, but we don’t need to worry about most of it when we’re web scraping. When we perform web scraping, we’re interested in the main content of the web page, so we look primarily at the HTML.

HTML
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the language that web pages are created in. HTML isn’t a programming language, like Python, though. It’s a markup language that tells a browser how to display content. 

HTML has many functions that are similar to what you might find in a word processor like Microsoft Word — it can make text bold, create paragraphs, and so on.

If you're already familiar with HTML, feel free to jump to the next section of this tutorial. Otherwise, let’s take a quick tour through HTML so we know enough to scrape effectively.

HTML consists of elements called tags. The most basic tag is the <html> tag. This tag tells the web browser that everything inside of it is HTML. We can make a simple HTML document just using this tag:



<html>
</html>
We haven’t added any content to our page yet, so if we viewed our HTML document in a web browser, we wouldn’t see anything:

Right inside an html tag, we can put two other tags: the head tag, and the body tag.

The main content of the web page goes into the body tag. The head tag contains data about the title of the page, and other information that generally isn’t useful in web scraping:



<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
We still haven’t added any content to our page (that goes inside the body tag), so if we open this HTML file in a browser, we still won’t see anything:

You may have noticed above that we put the head and body tags inside the html tag. In HTML, tags are nested, and can go inside other tags.

We’ll now add our first content to the page, inside a p tag. The p tag defines a paragraph, and any text inside the tag is shown as a separate paragraph:



<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
<p>
Here's a paragraph of text!
</p>
<p>
Here's a second paragraph of text!
</p>
</body>
</html>
Rendered in a browser, that HTML file will look like this:

Here’s a paragraph of text!

Here’s a second paragraph of text!

Tags have commonly used names that depend on their position in relation to other tags:

child — a child is a tag inside another tag. So the two p tags above are both children of the body tag.
parent — a parent is the tag another tag is inside. Above, the html tag is the parent of the body tag.
sibiling — a sibiling is a tag that is nested inside the same parent as another tag. For example, head and body are siblings, since they’re both inside html. Both p tags are siblings, since they’re both inside body.
We can also add properties to HTML tags that change their behavior. Below, we'll add some extra text and hyperlinks using the a tag.



<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>

<p>
Here's a second paragraph of text!
<a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> </p>
</body></html>
Here’s how this will look:

Here’s a second paragraph of text! Python

In the above example, we added two a tags. a tags are links, and tell the browser to render a link to another web page. The href property of the tag determines where the link goes.

a and p are extremely common html tags. Here are a few others:

div — indicates a division, or area, of the page.
b — bolds any text inside.
i — italicizes any text inside.
table — creates a table.
form — creates an input form.
For a full list of tags, look here.

Before we move into actual web scraping, let’s learn about the class and id properties. These special properties give HTML elements names, and make them easier to interact with when we’re scraping.

One element can have multiple classes, and a class can be shared between elements. Each element can only have one id, and an id can only be used once on a page. Classes and ids are optional, and not all elements will have them.

We can add classes and ids to our example:



<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
<p class="bold-paragraph">
Here's a paragraph of text!
